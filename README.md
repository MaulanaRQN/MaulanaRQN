### 🧠 About Me
I’m that kind of person who gets obsessed with an idea at 3AM...  
and by 4AM, it’s half-working, half-breaking, but kinda beautiful.  

- 🔬 Scientist who codes stuff just to understand *why* it breaks.  
- 🧰 Mostly live inside **Arch Linux** — because I like pain, apparently.  
- ⚙️ Messing around with **C / C++ / Go / Python / C# / Qt / OpenGL / ImGui**.  
- 🧩 Currently tinkering with **Minecraft internals**, **VPNs**, and **AI side projects**.  
- ⚡ I lose interest fast... unless something *really bugs me* — then I’ll debug it till sunrise.  

---

### 🧩 Current Experiments
- 🧠 Writing my own **programming language** (because why not).  
- 🌐 Building a **custom VPN + Minecraft server** combo.  
- 🧰 Creating a **Qt-based GCode editor/viewer**.  
- ⚡ Playing with **low-level logic**, **hardware**, and **self-learning AI tools**.

---

### 🔥 Random Facts
- I break stuff to learn faster.  
- I read docs *only after* it crashes.  
- I believe overengineering is a love language.  
- I think better with terminal sounds in the background.

### 🧰 Tools of the Trade
```bash
Languages: C | C++ | C# | Go | Python
Frameworks: Qt | ImGui | OpenGL
Systems: Arch Linux | Wayland | Hyperland

### 🧠 Philosophy

> Build. Break. Learn. Repeat.
> Simplicity is cool — but chaos teaches faster.
