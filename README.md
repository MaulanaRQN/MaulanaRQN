### About Me
I’m that kind of person who gets obsessed with an idea at 3AM...  
and by 4AM, it’s half-working, half-breaking, but kinda beautiful.  

- Mostly live inside **Arch Linux** — because I like pain, apparently.  
- Messing around with **C / C++ / Go / Python / C# / Qt / OpenGL / ImGui**.  
- Currently tinkering with **Minecraft internals**, **VPNs**, and **AI side projects**.  
- I lose interest fast... unless something *really bugs me* — then I’ll debug it till sunrise.

### Random Facts
- I break stuff to learn faster.  
- I read docs *only after* it crashes.  
- I believe overengineering is a love language.  
- I think better with terminal sounds in the background.

### Tools of the Trade
```bash
Languages: C | C++ | C# | Go | Python
Frameworks: Qt | ImGui | OpenGL
Systems: Arch Linux | Wayland | Hyperland | Debian
